At the end of the challenge, you will have to present your work. 
[An example presentation is given in this link.](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1sylXx_1EBl5qYfyH_QlqFcZS-2x16dHeo8TrIMAowPM/edit?usp=sharing)
A rubric for the judges is below: 

| Criteria  | 0   |  5  | 10  |
| -------------------- | ---------------------- | ------------------ | ----------|
| Debugging | Gave up trying to solve problems with the code |Solved all the errors in the code and could run all the code successfully | Solved all the errors and was able to explain what caused them |
| Model Training | Model did not run | Model is trained, but there are problems in the procedure/it is poorly documented | Model is trained and evaluation data is set aside for calculating model performance |
| Model Evaluation | No predictions are produced | Team is able to produce results, but cannot give an analysis of them | Team shows results including labeled evaluation data and aggregate metrics |
| Team Work | One person did all the work | Some group members aren't fully involved in the problem solving | All team members contributed to solutions, can answer question about the challenge |
| Presentation | Presentation doesn't represent the steps taken during the challenge, there are big gaps in the narrative | The group can talk about what they did, but doesn't talk about why | Group is able to explain their approach to the problem and the steps they took to solve them, including the reason for the problem in the first place |
